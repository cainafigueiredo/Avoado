# AVOADO
This repository is about my Entrepreneurship's final project. This project is based on Effectuation theory, created by Saras Sarasvathy, and its purpose is to facilitate the transition from that state where the potential entrepreneur knows what means he/she has, but he/she can't imagine what it is possible to do with them. So, my hypothesis is that he/she can get a number of insights through an analysis of the experience of entrepreneurs with similar means. For that, I propose the "AVOADO" system.

## Where AVOADO's name come from?
One of the Effectuation's principles is "Bird in Hand". Broadly speaking, it posits that effectual entrepreneurs start by looking at their resources so that they can imagine a number of possible futures they can create instead of having a fixed end in their mind. In particular, they try to capture three aspects: "who am I?", "who I know?" and "whom I know?". Curiously, it may be possible that someone can answer easily these questions and, at the same time, they can't to imagine what can be done with them. This state of confusion and the principle's name motivated me to name the system as "AVOADO" (In portuguese, one of the meanings of this word is confusion).
